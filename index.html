                <h2>My First Car - 1974 Orange VW Bug</h2>  
                    <p>Great car and very reliable. As my father used to say, 
                    "the less it has on it, the less there is to break." So, 
                    not much here to break. No AC; no real heater;
                    manual transmission; manual widows, locks, etc. But such
                    great fun to drive. I should also mention one of my favorite
                    things about the old bugs...the front window vents. I still miss 
                    those vents.</p>

                <h2>Volkswagen Rabbit*</h2>
                    <p>Just as bare-bones as the Beetle, but far from reliable. And so ugly!
                    This car was noisy and uncomfortable and in constant 
                    need of expensive repairs. It did still have the window
                    vents, which is helpful when you have no air conditioning,
                    but they didn't function quite as nicely as the ones on the 
                    bug.</p>

                <h2>1984 Datsun/Nissan Maxima Wagon</h2>
                    <p>My boss at the time didn't think much of my VW Rabbit, so
                    he offered me a $200 per month car allowance if 
                    I would buy something else. I bought a used Maxima
                    Wagon which was a HUGE step up for me. It was super 
                    luxurious compared to what I had driven in the past. Cushy fabric
                    seats; power windows and doors; nice stereo; great
                    ride; and very reliable. The boss didn't like it. Oh well.
                    1984 was the transition year for the Datsun/Nissan name change.
                    This car, like all cars manufactured in 1984, carried both the 
                    Datsun and Nissan labels.</p>

                <h2>Chrysler Grand Caravan Woody</h2>
                    <p>The first of three Chrysler minivans  I've owned, 
                    my husband talked me into buying this one. 
                    Immediately after I bought this I came down with a bad case of buyer's
                    remorse, but it wasn't long before I was appreciating all that a minivan had 
                    to offer. Although I've owned and driven other vehicles over the last 
                    25 years, I have never been without a minivan. They've 
                    been great for vacations; chauffering kids and teenagers and their 
                    friends; hauling equipment and building materials for projects; picking up
                    large purchases; and hauling merchandise from my
                    various businesses to various selling venues. I can't imagine the 
                    inconvenience of not owning a minivan.</p>

                <h2>1997 Teal Chrysler Grand Caravan</h2>
                    <p>My second minivan was only one year old when I purchased it, so it was
                    as close to a new car as I had ever had. I owned this van for about 16 years 
                    and put about 130,000 miles on it. It served my family and me well, and I have 
                    fond memories of my children associated with it. In it's later years it was an 
                    extra vehicle, coming in handy when needed.</p>

                <h2>2001 VW New Beetle TDI</h2>
                    <p>An acquaintance suggested that this was my mid-life crisis 
                    vehicle. Whatever. It was fun, cute, and had the little 
                    luxuries that the original beatles lacked. And the diesel 
                    engine meant that I got 40+ mpg...plus diesel was cheaper 
                    than gas at that time. Unfortunately, it didn't have the 
                    reliability of the original. When my daughter got her driver's 
                    license, this became the car she drove.</p>

                    <p>This vehicle was purchased for my daughter's use but I drove 
                    it for a few months first. It had massive tires and I had to 
                    climb to get in it. We had some fun with this vehicle, including one 
                    of my childrens' and my favorite memories; I woke them at 3:00&#160;AM on 
                    the night of the big ice storm and we drove all over town looking
                    at the storm damage. Other than a few emergency vehicles, we were the 
                    only people on the road. With the kids bundled up on top of their 
                    pajamas, the eery quiet everywhere we went, and the lights glowing 
                    through the coat of ice covering everything, it was absolutely magical.</p>

                    <p>This was my first-ever brand-new car. Although it was small
                    and fuel-efficient (the price of gas at that time was nearly $4.00 per 
                    gallon), it had nearly all the bells and whistles at a great price. 
                    My daughter still drives this car and has been very happy with it.
                    She has never had to have it serviced other than scheduled maintenance.</p>

                <h2>2002 White Hail-Damaged Acura TL</h2>
                    <p>This is another car that was purchased as a vehicle for my daughter to use,
                    but of course I had to drive it for awhile first. I liked it so much I 
                    just couldn't give it up. Instead, I let her have my much newer Elantra. 
                    Even though the Acura was 9 years old when I got it, 
                    I drove it for four more years without having to do anything other than change
                    the oil. Plus, after four years, my son sold it for me for more than I paid for it. 
                    It was a wonderful car to drive and I really didn't care about the
                    extensive hail damage. In fact, we had two more bad hail storms after I 
                    bought it. No worries.</p>

                <h2>2005 Silver Chrysler Town and Country</h2>
                    <p>My third minivan, and nicest, and my current vehicle. Heated leather seats
                    are an option that has become important to me in a car. In order to get the 
                    leather seats you generally have to get a top-of-the-line model, which is okay
                    with me. But some of the extras are wasted on me. I nearly lost this vehicle
                    very recently. Someone broke in and attempted to steal it while it was 
                    parked on Bayard next to Launchcode.</p>

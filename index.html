         <h1>My First Car - Orange 1972 VW Beetle</h1>
                <p>Great car. Reliable - so few goodies that there 
                    was very little that could go wrong. No AC; manual 
                    transmission; manual widows, locks,etc. Great fun 
                    to drive.
        <h1>VW Rabbit*</h1>
                <p>Just as bare-bones as the Beetle, but far from reliable.
                    This car was noisy and uncomfortable and in constant 
                    need of expensive repairs.
        <h1>Datson/Nissan Maxima Wagon</h1>
                <p>My boss didn't think much  of my VW Rabbit so
                    he offered me a $200 per month car allowance if 
                    I would buy something else. I bought a used Maxima
                    Wagon that was a HUGE step up for me. It was super 
                    luxurious compared to what I had driven. Cushy fabric
                    seats; power windows and doors; nice stereo; great
                    ride; and very reliable. I don't remember ever taking 
                    it to a mechanic.
        <h1>The First of Three Chrysler Minivans</h1>
                <p>My husband talked me into buying this first minivan. 
                    Shortly fterward, I regretted allowing him to influence
                    me, but it wasn't long before I was appreciating all it had 
                    to offer. Although I've owned other vehicles over the last 
                    25 years, I have never been without a minivan. They've 
                    been great for chauffering kids and teenagers and their 
                    friends; hauling building materials for projects; picking up
                    large purchases; vacations; and hauling merchandise from my
                    various businesses to selling venues. I can't imagine the 
                    level of inconvenience of not owning a minivan.
                    </p>
        <h1>VW New Beetle TDI</h1>
                <p>An acquaintance suggested that this was my mid-life crisis 
                    vehicle. Whatever. It was fun, cute, and had the little 
                    luxuries that the original beatles lacked. And the diesel 
                    engine meant that I got 40+ mpg...plus diesel was cheaper 
                    than gas at that time. Unfortunately, it didn't have the 
                    reliability of the original. When my daughter got her driver's 
                    license, this became the car she drove.

        <h1>Four Wheel Dive Ford Ranger</h1>
                <p>This vehicle was purchased for my daughter's use but I drove 
                    it for a few months first. It had massive tires and I had to 
                    climb to get in it. We had some fun with this vehicle, including one 
                    of my childrens' and my favorite memories; I woke them at 3am on 
                    the night of the big ice storm and we drove all over town looking
                    at the storm damage.

        <h1>Brand-New 2008 Hyundai Elantra Limited with Leather Seats</h1>
                <p>This was my first-ever brand-new car. Although it was small
                    and fuel-efficient, it had nearly all the bells and whistles
                    at a great price. My daughter still drives this car and loves it.
                    She has never had to have it serviced other than  maintenance.</p>
                </p>
        <h1>White Hail-Damaged Acura TL</h1>
                </p>This car was purchased as a vehicle for my daughter to use
                but I drove it for awhile first and fell in love with it. Instead, I let 
                her have my much newer Elantra. Even though the Acurs was ten years old, 
                I drove it for four years without having to do anything other than change
                the oil. Plus, after four years, I sold it for more than I paid for it. 
                It was a wonderful car to drive and I really didn't care about the
                extensive hail damage. In fact, we had two more bad hail storms after I 
                bought it. No worries,
                </p>

* Although model years aren't all etched in my memory, I could probably come up with them 
if I thought about it for a while and di some research.
